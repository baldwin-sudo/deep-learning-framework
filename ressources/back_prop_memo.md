Here's a Markdown explanation summarizing the concepts you've understood about backpropagation:

## Backpropagation Overview

Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by updating the weights and biases of each layer based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. It works by propagating the error (the loss) backwards from the output layer to the input layer, layer by layer.

### 1. **Forward Pass**
In the forward pass, for each layer \(i\):

- The pre-activation \(Z_i\) is computed as:
  \[
  Z_i = W_i \cdot A_{i-1} + b_i
  \]
  where:
  - \( W_i \) is the weight matrix of layer \(i\).
  - \( A_{i-1} \) is the output (activation) of the previous layer \(i-1\) (or the input to the network for the first layer).
  - \( b_i \) is the bias of layer \(i\).
  
- The activation \(A_i\) is computed by applying the activation function \(f\) to \(Z_i\):
  \[
  A_i = f(Z_i)
  \]
  where \(f(Z_i)\) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.).

### 2. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**
In the backward pass, for each layer \(i\), we need to compute the gradients and propagate the error back to the previous layers. There are two main components we need to calculate:

#### 2.1 **Gradient with Respect to the Output of Layer \(i\) (Activations)**
- \( dA_i \) is the gradient of the total loss \( E_{\text{tot}} \) with respect to the activations \( A_i \). This gradient is passed backward from the loss function (if it's the output layer) or from the subsequent layer (if it's a hidden layer).

#### 2.2 **Gradient with Respect to the Pre-Activation (\(Z_i\))**
- The gradient of the loss with respect to \( Z_i \) (the pre-activation of layer \(i\)) is:
  \[
  dZ_i = dA_i \cdot f'(Z_i)
  \]
  where:
  - \( f'(Z_i) \) is the derivative of the activation function applied to \( Z_i \).

#### 2.3 **Gradient with Respect to Weights and Biases**
- The gradients of the loss with respect to the weights \( W_i \) and biases \( b_i \) are:
  \[
  dW_i = dZ_i \cdot A_{i-1}^T
  \]
  \[
  db_i = dZ_i
  \]
  where \( A_{i-1}^T \) is the transpose of the activations from the previous layer.

#### 2.4 **Gradient with Respect to the Input (\(X_i\))**
- The gradient of the loss with respect to the input of layer \(i\) (which is \( X_i \), the input to the layer \(i\)) is:
  \[
  dX_i = W_i^T \cdot dZ_i
  \]
  This is the gradient passed back to the previous layer as \( dA_{i-1} \), which will be used by the previous layer to compute its own gradients.

### Key Points:
1. **Forward Pass**:
   - Compute activations for each layer.
   - Output of layer \(i\): \( A_i = f(Z_i) \).

2. **Backward Pass**:
   - Compute \( dZ_i \), the gradient with respect to the pre-activation.
   - Compute \( dW_i \) and \( db_i \) to update the weights and biases.
   - Compute \( dX_i \) (or \( dA_{i-1} \)), which is the gradient of the loss with respect to the input to the current layer, and pass it back to the previous layer.

---

### The Flow of Gradients:
- **\( dA_i \)**: Loss gradient with respect to the current layer's activation (output).
- **\( dZ_i \)**: Loss gradient with respect to the current layer's pre-activation (input to the activation function).
- **\( dX_i \)**: Loss gradient with respect to the input of layer \(i\), which is passed back to the previous layer.

---

### Summary:
For layer \(i\):
- **Step 1**: Calculate the loss gradient with respect to the activation \( dA_i \) (this comes from the next layer or the loss function).
- **Step 2**: Compute the gradient with respect to the pre-activation \( dZ_i = dA_i \cdot f'(Z_i) \).
- **Step 3**: Compute the gradients with respect to weights and biases:
  \[
  dW_i = dZ_i \cdot A_{i-1}^T
  \]
  \[
  db_i = dZ_i
  \]
- **Step 4**: Compute the gradient with respect to the input, which is passed back to the previous layer:
  \[
  dX_i = W_i^T \cdot dZ_i
  \]

This process is repeated layer by layer during training to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the total loss. The gradients allow us to know how to change the weights and biases to reduce the error, and the backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes these gradients across all layers.
