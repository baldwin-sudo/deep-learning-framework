Great! After trying **SGD** (Stochastic Gradient Descent), **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD)**, and **Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)**, you can try the following optimizers, which progressively introduce more advanced techniques:

### 1. **Momentum** (a variant of gradient descent)

- **Description**: Momentum helps accelerate the gradient vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging.
- **How it works**: It adds a fraction of the previous update to the current update. This helps in smoothing the optimization path and prevents oscillations.

   **Formula**:
   \[
   v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta) \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \theta - \alpha v_t
   \]
   Where:

- \( v_t \) is the velocity (moving average of gradients).
- \( \beta \) is the momentum coefficient (typically 0.9).
- \( \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta) \) is the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters.

### 2. **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)**

- **Description**: Nesterov is a smarter version of Momentum. Instead of updating the weights first and then looking at the gradient, it looks ahead by using the "lookahead" gradient, giving it more information about the update direction.
- **How it works**: It computes the gradient at a future point, allowing the optimizer to take more informed steps.

   **Formula**:
   \[
   v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta - \alpha \beta v_{t-1})
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \theta - \alpha v_t
   \]
   Where:

- \( v_t \) is the updated velocity.
- \( \beta \) is the momentum coefficient.
- \( \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta - \alpha \beta v_{t-1}) \) is the gradient computed after the "lookahead" step.

### 3. **Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)**

- **Description**: Adagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on how frequently it gets updated. Parameters that receive frequent updates will have their learning rate reduced, while parameters with fewer updates will have higher learning rates.
- **How it works**: It adapts the learning rate individually for each parameter, which can be useful when features have very different scales.

   **Formula**:
   \[
   G_t = G_{t-1} + \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)^2
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \theta - \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)
   \]
   Where:

- \( G_t \) is the accumulated sum of squared gradients.
- \( \epsilon \) is a small constant to prevent division by zero (usually \( 10^{-8} \)).
- \( \alpha \) is the global learning rate.

### 4. **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)**

- **Description**: RMSprop is similar to Adagrad, but it uses a moving average of squared gradients to prevent the learning rate from decaying too quickly.
- **How it works**: It divides the learning rate by a running average of recent gradient magnitudes to scale the updates. This keeps the learning rate from decreasing too much and helps achieve faster convergence.

   **Formula**:
   \[
   v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta) \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)^2
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \theta - \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{v_t + \epsilon}} \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)
   \]
   Where:

- \( v_t \) is the moving average of squared gradients.
- \( \beta \) is a decay factor (usually around 0.9).
- \( \epsilon \) is a small constant for numerical stability.

### 5. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**

- **Description**: Adam combines the advantages of both momentum and RMSprop. It uses both the running average of past gradients (like momentum) and the running average of squared gradients (like RMSprop), making it one of the most popular optimizers.
- **How it works**: Adam adapts the learning rate for each parameter and adjusts for momentum, which helps in faster convergence.

   **Formula**:
   \[
   m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)
   \]
   \[
   v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta)^2
   \]
   \[
   \hat{m_t} = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}
   \]
   \[
   \hat{v_t} = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t}
   \]
   \[
   \theta = \theta - \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{\hat{v_t}} + \epsilon} \hat{m_t}
   \]
   Where:

- \( m_t \) is the first moment (moving average of gradients).
- \( v_t \) is the second moment (moving average of squared gradients).
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2 \) are the exponential decay rates for the moment estimates (commonly \( \beta_1 = 0.9 \) and \( \beta_2 = 0.999 \)).
- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
- \( \epsilon \) is a small constant for numerical stability.

### Summary of Difficulty Progression

1. **Momentum**
2. **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)**
3. **Adagrad**
4. **RMSprop**
5. **Adam**

Each optimizer builds on the concepts of the previous one and introduces more advanced features, such as adapting the learning rate and using running averages to improve convergence.

### Next Steps

- Start with **Momentum** and then try **NAG** as a next step.
- Afterward, experiment with **Adagrad** or **RMSprop** to see how the model responds.
- Finally, try **Adam**, which is the most commonly used optimizer in practice for many problems due to its good performance in a wide range of tasks.
